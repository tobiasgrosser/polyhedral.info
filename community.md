======

This is a non-exhaustive list of people involved in the polyhedral community.
Whoever feels to be part of this community is invited to
[contribute](/contribute.html) his personal profile.

#### Albert Cohen

![Albert Cohen](/images/people/cohen.jpg)

Albert is an INRIA Senior Research Scientist Associate Professor at École
Polytechnique. His interests cover serveral aspects of compilation and
interactions between architectures and programming languages. The general
direction is program analysis and optimisation for high-performance
general-purpose processors or specialized and embedded architectures.

#### Christophe Alias

![Christophe Alias](/images/people/alias.jpg)

Christophe Alias is a research scientist (CR1) at Inria. His research interests
include theoretical and practical aspects of polyhedral compilation. After a
PhD thesis on polyhedral program synthesis, he worked on automatic
parallelization, memory optimization and automated pipelining for high-level
synthesis.  Beside, he is the main developer of Dcc, a HLS specific polyhedral
compiler suite, which is the cornerstone of the XtremLogic startup, that he has
co-founded with Alexandru Plesco.

Tobias is a PhD student working on vectorization for CPUs and accelerators with
the goal of moving polyhedral tools into todays production compilers.

Tobias is the maintainer of [LLVM/Polly](http://polly.llvm.org) and code reviewer
for the [GCC/Graphite](http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Graphite-4.8).
